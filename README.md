Welcome to the **Backdoor** repository. This project is a Python-based backdoor and server communication tool designed for ethical hacking and reverse shell practice. It utilizes socket programming to facilitate command execution, file transfer, and remote access.



## Introduction
This project is intended for ethical learning and research only. Do not use it to compromise systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test. Always perform testing inside isolated lab environments (virtual machines, air-gapped networks, or dedicated test networks) and follow all applicable laws and organizational policies.
